# High-score Service

This is an implementation of [melvint's](https://github.com/melvinmt) [PHP Backend Challenge](https://github.com/melvinmt/php-challenge). It is a RESTful service, written in PHP, that allows a game to post a user's score for ranking on a leaderboard. The implementation does not rely on any third-party frameworks or libraries. Composer is used for basic autoloading functionality.


# Generating Test Data

Test data can be generated by sending a `POST` request to `/seeder`. You must include a `num` key along with a corresponding value (e.g.: `num` = `1000000`).

```
POST  /seeder`
```
#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| num | int | Required. Number of test records to generate |

# Recording Scores

Individual score entries can be recorded by sending a `POST` request to `/score`. You must include a valid `signed_request` and key/value pair, as well as a user_score key/value pair.


```
POST  /score
```
#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| signed_request | string | *Required.* Signed request from Facebook |
| user_score | int | *Required.* User score |


# Reporting

Reports be generated by sending `GET` requests to the following endpoints:


Daily and all-time total number of players:
```
GET  /report/totals
```


Top 10 players (by score):
```
GET  /report/top
```


Top {num} players (by score):
```
GET  /report/top/num
```


Most improved as compared with last week:
```
GET  /report/improved
```


All reports above combined:
```
GET  /report

# To Dos
Due to time constraints, this version only uses a single `scores` table to handle score records. A future version would include a `users` table containing at minimum `fname`, `lname`, and `fb_user_id`, fields , while removing `fb_user_id` from the `scores` table, and adding `user_id`. New score entries would include a new `select id from users where fb_user_id ...`, then an insert to the `scores` table with the acquired user_id. Final reports would include a left outer join with `users` on `user.id` = `scores.user_id`, or something similar.
