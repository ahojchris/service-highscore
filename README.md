# High-score Service

This is an implementation of [melvint's](https://github.com/melvinmt) [PHP Backend Challenge](https://github.com/melvinmt/php-challenge). It is a RESTful service, written in PHP, that allows a game to post a user's score for ranking on a leaderboard. The implementation does not rely on any third-party frameworks or libraries. Composer is used for basic autoloading functionality.


# Generating Test Data

Test data can be generated by sending a `POST` request to `/seeder`. You must include a `num` key along with a corresponding value (e.g.: `num` = `1000000`).

`POST` `/seeder` `num`

# Recording Scores

Individual score entries can be recorded by sending a `POST` request to `/score`. You must include a valid `signed_request` and key/value pair, as well as a user_score key/value pair.

`POST` `/score` `signed_request` `user_score`

For example:
```
signed_request:

# Reporting

Reports be generated by sending a `GET` request to the following endpoints:

`GET` `/report/totals` - Daily and all-time total number of players

`GET` `/report/top` - Top 10 players (by score)

`GET` `/report/improved` - Most improved as compared with last week

`GET` `/report` - All reports above combined

# To Dos
Due to time constraints, this version only uses a single `scores` table to handle score records. A future version would include a `users` table containing at minimum `fname`, `lname`, and `fb_user_id`, fields , while removing `fb_user_id` and adding `user_id` to the `scores` table. New scores would begin with a select in the users table to get the user id from the fb_user_id, then an insert to scores with the user_id. Final reports would include a left outer join with `users` on user.id = scores.user_id, or something similar.
